# Computer-Vision-Foundations-and-More

This repository contains foundational practice of concepts of Computer Vision in an ascending order of complexity and understandability. This is prepared as a learning journey by **Sajjan Acharya**.

### 1. [Feature Description](https://github.com/S-acharya57/Computer-Vision-Foundations-and-More/tree/main/Feature%20Description)

- [Harris Corner Detection](https://github.com/S-acharya57/Computer-Vision-Foundations-and-More/blob/main/Feature%20Description/Harris%20Corner%20Detection.ipynb) : Implementation of Harris corner detection with use of trace of matrix, eigen values and harris response.

### 2. [Image Processing](https://github.com/S-acharya57/Computer-Vision-Foundations-and-More/tree/main/3.%20Image%20Processing)

- [Compositing and Matting images](https://github.com/S-acharya57/Computer-Vision-Foundations-and-More/blob/main/3.%20Image%20Processing/compositing-matting.ipynb)
- [Pixel Processing and Basic Convolution Filter](https://github.com/S-acharya57/Computer-Vision-Foundations-and-More/blob/main/3.%20Image%20Processing/inference%20fonv%20filter.ipynb)
  - Implementation of changing contrast and brightness via pixel operations.
  - Implementing basic convolution of an image with a kernel function, and rewritten using vectorized functions for faster inference.

### 3. [Important CNN architectures]()

- [Inception and Auxiliary Classifiers](https://github.com/S-acharya57/Computer-Vision-Foundations-and-More/blob/main/GoogleNet/Inception_And_AuxiliaryClassifiers.ipynb) : Use of inception module for feature extraction, and visualization of feature maps for input images.

### 4. [Vision Transformer (ViT)](https://github.com/S-acharya57/Computer-Vision-Foundations-and-More/tree/main/Vision%20Transformer)

- [Demonstration of patch embedding in ViT](https://github.com/S-acharya57/Computer-Vision-Foundations-and-More/blob/main/Vision%20Transformer/patchEmbedding.ipynb) : Implementation of patch embeddings using convolution filter to split the images in different patches. Use of MNIST data for easier visualization.
